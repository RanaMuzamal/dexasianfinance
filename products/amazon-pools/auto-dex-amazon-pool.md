# Auto DEX Amazon Pool



## Stake DEX, earn DEX!

You've now got two delicious flavors of DEX Amazon Pool to choose from: Auto-compounding, and Manual. Read on to learn more!

### What’s the difference between the “Auto DEX Pool” and the “Manual DEX Pool”? <a href="docs-internal-guid-c4c16237-7fff-3c33-3a56-18ccd8853f86" id="docs-internal-guid-c4c16237-7fff-3c33-3a56-18ccd8853f86"></a>

**With both pools, you can simply stake your DEX tokens to earn more DEX tokens.**

But there are some differences:

**Manual DEX**

* You need to harvest or compound (reinvest) your DEX by yourself. That means returning to the site, tapping buttons, and using a bit of BNB for transaction fees.
* Interest is displayed as APR, which doesn’t include compounding.
* Deposits Amazon Token to your wallet upon staking

**Auto ADEX**

* Stake your DEX and forget about it! The DEX you stake in this Amazon Pool will be automatically compounded (reinvested) for you, minus a small fee.
* The “automatic” compounding function is triggered by other users who get a small bounty for triggering it.
* Interest is displayed as APY, which includes compounding.
* A small performance fee is subtracted from your earnings each time the pool is automatically compounded. See below.
* An unstaking fee applies when you unstake within 3 days of manually staking. See below.
* Does not deposit Amazon to your wallet upon staking

### What are the fees for the Auto DEX Amazon Pool?

**Deposit fee**

* **None**

\*\*Unstaking fee \*\*

* **0.1%  if you unstake (withdraw) within 72 hours.**
* Only applies within 3 days of manually staking.
* After 3 days, you can unstake with **no fee**.
* The 3-day timer resets every time you manually stake more DEX in the pool.
* This fee only applies to manual unstaking: it does not apply to automatic compounding.

**Performance fee**

* **2%, subtracted automatically from each yield harvest**.
* For example, if the harvest was 1 DEX, then 0.02 DEX would be subtracted as the performance fee.

{% hint style="info" %}
The DEX collected via the unstaking fee and performance fee is **burned every week** as part of the regular DEX token burns.

This is a good thing for DEX holders because it reduces the overall amount of DEX tokens in existence, which helps reduce inflation.

### What's the best way to use the Auto DEX Amazon Pool? <a href="docs-internal-guid-3b1f91a6-7fff-fc76-976a-3a06bada2520" id="docs-internal-guid-3b1f91a6-7fff-fc76-976a-3a06bada2520"></a>

Simple: stake your DEX, but only withdraw after 72 hours (if you need to). This way you only pay the performance fee, and not the unstaking fee.

### What’s the Auto DEX bounty?

**Auto DEX Bounty: 0.05% of all Auto DEX pool users’ pending yield**

This bounty is given as a reward for providing a service to other users.

Whenever you successfully claim the bounty, you’re also helping out by activating the Auto DEX Pool’s compounding function for everyone.

Make sure the amount of DEX you receive will be greater than the BNB fees you’ll spend to submit the blockchain transaction!
