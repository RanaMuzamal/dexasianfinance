# Manual DEX Amazon Pool



## Stake DEX, earn DEX!

You've now got ADEX Amazon Pool to choose from. Manual only. Read on to learn more!

Dex Asian (DEX) is a unique reflection token and also earns you 5% USDT rewards ( we recommend you harvest your rewards as often as possible so your USDT reflections show in your wallet and you reap the full reward.

****

**Manual ADEX**

* You need to harvest or compound (reinvest) your DEX by yourself. That means returning to the site, tapping buttons, and using a bit of BNB for transaction fees.
* Interest is displayed as APR, which doesn’t include compounding.
* Deposits Amazon Token to your wallet upon staking



### What are the fees for the **Manual** DEX Amazon Pool?

**Deposit fee**

* **None**

\*\*Unstaking fee \*\*

* **0.1%  if you unstake (withdraw) within 72 hours.**
* Only applies within 3 days of manually staking.
* After 3 days, you can unstake with **no fee**.
* The 3-day timer resets every time you manually stake more DEX in the pool.
* This fee only applies to manual unstaking: it does not apply to automatic compounding.

**Performance fee**

* **2%, subtracted automatically from each yield harvest**.
* For example, if the harvest was 1 DEX, then 0.02 DEX would be subtracted as the performance fee.

### What’s the Auto DEX bounty?

**Auto DEX Bounty: 0.05% of all Auto DEX pool users’ pending yield**

This bounty is given as a reward for providing a service to other users.

Whenever you successfully claim the bounty, you’re also helping out by activating the Auto DEX Pool’s compounding function for everyone.

Make sure the amount of DEX you receive will be greater than the BNB fees you’ll spend to submit the blockchain transaction!
