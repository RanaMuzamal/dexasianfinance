## How can I stake ADEX?

## What is the difference between staking and farming?

Staking in Amazon Pools and farming with Yield Farming are both ways to earn more ADEX by supporting Alpine Dex.

## Is Dex Asian protected from flash loan attacks?

Alpine DeX's vault has anti-flash loan protection. Dex Asian’s DEX token isn’t vulnerable to flash loan attacks. Unlike vulnerable tokens, DEX token minting is predefined, and can’t be adjusted in a single transaction. Ownership cannot be transferred outside of MasterBuilder contract.

Dex Asian’s other smart contracts are protected as well; they prevent other contracts from interacting with them, reducing the scope of vector attacks.
