# How to Stake in Amazon Pools





Staking in [Amazon Pools ](broken-reference)lets you earn Adex or other tokens while you sleep!

It's simpler than farming with Alpine Dex's Yield Farms, because unlike the Farms, you only need to stake **one token** to start earning: usually ADEX.

## **Getting started with Amazon Pool staking**

1\. Go to the Pools page[ here.](broken-reference)

2\. Connect to your Binance Smart Chain-compatible wallet by clicking the **Connect** button (top right-hand side).

3\. Click **Unlock Wallet**.

4\. Choose which Amazon Pool you want to stake in.

**Auto ADEX** automatically compounds your rewards: any ADEX you earn will be harvested and re-invested in the same pool for you.

**Manual ADEX** doesn’t automatically compound like Auto ADEX. You’ll need to harvest and compound your earnings manually.

**Manual PINE** doesn’t automatically compound like Auto PINE. You’ll need to harvest and compound your earnings manually.



Other Amazon Pools let you stake your ADEX to earn dozens of other cool tokens. Make sure you check them out.\\

### **Adding and removing ADEX from a pool** \*\*\*\*

You can easily add more ADEX to an Amazon Pool, or move some ADEX to a more profitable pool. Here’s how you can move your staked ADEX.

1\. Click the **-** to take some ADEX out of a pool, or the **+** to add more to the pool.

![](broken-reference)

Please note that unstaking from the Auto ADEX pool has a fee of 0.1% if you unstake within 72 hours.

2\. A window will open. If you clicked the **+**, choose the amount you would like to add to the pool. If you clicked the **-**, choose the amount to take out of the pool.

3\. Click **Confirm**.

4\. After a little wait, you'll be able to see your new amount of staked tokens.
